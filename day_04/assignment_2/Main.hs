{- For added security, yet another system policy has been put in place. Now, a
 - valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other -
 - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word's letters can be rearranged to
 - form any other word in the passphrase.
 -
 - For example:
 -
 - * abcde fghij is a valid passphrase.
 - * abcde xyz ecdab is not valid - the letters from the third word can be
 -   rearranged to form the first word.
 - * a ab abc abd abf abj is a valid passphrase, because all letters need to be
 -   used when forming another word.
 - * iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo is valid.
 - * oiii ioii iioi iiio is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to
 -   form any other word.
 -
 - Under this new system policy, how many passphrases are valid? -}
